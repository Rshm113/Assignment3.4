NAMENODE : It is the centrepiece of the HDFS System. It keeps the directory tree of all files in the system. Also tracks the file across 
the cluster.Clients application directly contact with the namenode of the hdfs system. Clients can also move/delete/create/copy whenever
they want to do. The NameNode responds the successful requests by returning a list of relevant DataNode servers where the data lives.
HDFS is currently a High Availability system. When the NameNode goes down, the file system goes offline. There is an optional 
SecondaryNameNode that can be hosted on a separate machine. It only creates checkpoints of the namespace by merging the edits file into
the fsimage file and does not provide any real redundancy
